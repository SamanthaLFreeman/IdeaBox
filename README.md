###Project Description
For this Mod One project at Turing, our team of three increased our understanding of the 'data model' and 'dom model'. In addition, we had to learn and implement our new comprehension of `localStorage` and `data-*` attributes. Lastly, we made sure to practice creating clean and DRY HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the process.

###Turing students involved:
